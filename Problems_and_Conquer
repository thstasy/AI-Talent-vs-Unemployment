Throughout the process of analyzing the AI Global Index and Unemployment datasets, we encountered several challenges that required debugging. Below is a detailed log of the problems we faced and how we resolved them.

---

1. Issue: NameError: `pd` is not defined

Problem:
We encountered a NameError while attempting to load the datasets using the pd.read_csv() function, which occurs when the Pandas library is not imported.

Solution:
We solved this by importing the Pandas library at the start of the script:
import pandas as pd

2. Issue: SyntaxError: Non-printable character U+00A0

Problem:
A SyntaxError was triggered due to the presence of non-printable characters in the dataset (specifically U+00A0) while loading one of the CSV files. These characters sometimes exist when data is copied or exported from other environments.

Solution:
We addressed this by manually cleaning the dataset and replacing the non-printable characters. Additionally, we utilized the skipinitialspace=True option in Pandas to handle any leading/trailing spaces.

3. Issue: ValueError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'

Problem:
This error occurred while attempting to fill missing values for numeric columns. It was caused by non-numeric values (strings) in a column we expected to be entirely numeric.

Solution:
We resolved this by explicitly selecting only numeric columns using select_dtypes() and ensuring only numeric operations were performed.

---

4. Issue: KeyError: 'SalePrice' not found in dataset

Problem:
While trying to access the SalePrice column in the test dataset, we encountered a KeyError because the column was missing in the test data.

Solution:
To fix this, we ensured that the SalePrice column was only referenced in the training dataset and ignored during predictions on the test dataset.

5. Issue: ValueError: x and y must have same first dimension

Problem:
While plotting Unemployment Rate Trends (2020-2023), we encountered a ValueError due to mismatched dimensions of the x and y axes.

Solution:
We fixed this by ensuring that both axes had the same number of elements before plotting. We also added a check to ensure the country exists in the dataset before plotting it.

---

6. Issue: Boxplot Error for Region Column

Problem:
While trying to create a boxplot of unemployment rates by region, we encountered an error because the dataset did not contain a Region column.

Solution:
We resolved this by switching to the Country column instead of Region, and the boxplot was successfully generated.

---

7. Issue: Graph Window Not Large Enough for Cropping

Problem:
When generating bar charts, the window was not large enough for easy viewing and cropping of the images.

Solution:
We increased the figure size and DPI (dots per inch) for better resolution and ensured that the plots were saved as image files for easier use.
